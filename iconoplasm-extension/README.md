# Iconoplasm Extension

This folder is the canonical unpacked Chrome extension root for Iconoplasm.

Chesterton's fence: this folder is the runtime client, not the authoring workstation. If the published catalog, alias export, or Website Ops payload looks wrong, start in `d:\Coding\Datasets\iconoplasm` first. That sibling repo is the local control plane that publishes the catalog facts this extension consumes.

Reason for the move:

- keep the extension code easy to find from the website repo
- keep the tooltip/frontpage design work close together
- avoid losing track of the relevant files across two unrelated locations
- keep a single source of truth for local Chrome testing and future store packaging

## Packaging the extension safely

Do not zip this whole folder by hand.

That will drag in `store-assets/`, screenshots, promo files, and any local Playwright install under `store-assets/node_modules/`, which are dev-only and should not ship.

Use the repo-level package command instead:

- `npm run package:iconoplasm-extension`

What it does:

- copies only runtime files (`manifest.json`, JS/CSS/HTML, fonts, generated assets, icons)
- excludes `store-assets/`, docs, and other non-runtime files
- scans the staged payload for obvious secret patterns before zipping
- writes the clean package to `iconoplasm-extension/dist/`

Current output:

- staged runtime payload: `iconoplasm-extension/dist/package/`
- zip for upload/manual distribution: `iconoplasm-extension/dist/iconoplasm-extension-v<version>.zip`
