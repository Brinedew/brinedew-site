# Brinedew

I write about longevity research, computational biology, and systems thinking. My work focuses on the intersection of technology and life extension, exploring how computational approaches can accelerate our understanding of aging and disease.

## Recent Writing

- [The Computational Approach to Aging Biology](posts/computational-aging.md) — How machine learning is transforming longevity research
- [Systems Thinking in Biomedical Research](posts/systems-thinking-biology.md) — Moving beyond reductionist approaches

## Research Interests

My current focus areas include:

- **Computational longevity**: Applying ML/AI to aging research and biomarker discovery
- **Systems biology**: Understanding complex biological networks and their perturbations
- **Biogerontology**: The fundamental mechanisms of aging at cellular and organismal levels

## Selected Notes

- [Aging Biology Myths](aging%20biology%20myths/) — Debunking common misconceptions about aging research
- [Longevity Research Resources](resources/longevity-research.md) — Curated papers, datasets, and tools
