# The 'nav' section below is now optional if you use a root .pages file (see step 3).
# If you want to define the top-level order explicitly, you can use a .pages file.
# For a simpler start, you can remove the 'nav' section entirely and awesome-pages
# will list docs/index.md, docs/introduction.md, and the docs/concepts folder alphabetically.
# Let's try removing it for now, and we can add a .pages file if needed for ordering.
# nav:
#   - Home: index.md
#   - Introduction: introduction.md
